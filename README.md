# Fix My Code Challenge
  Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll dive into a code base that already exists and fix it! Pre-written repos are used as the starting point for all of the solutions in this. I'm only fixing the existing code base; I'm not writing any new code.

I was tasked with debugging multiple programs for a project that ALX delivered. The problems involved a range of programming languages, some of which I was familiar with and others of which I was not, including C, Python, Javascript, Ruby, and others. The following is a detailed list of the projects:
